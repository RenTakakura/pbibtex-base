These test files are derived from the old distribution of JBibTeX,
included in ptex-2.1.4 distribution archive (ptex-2.1.4/web2c/jbibtex)
and jtex1.7 distribution (jtex1.7/jtex/BibTeX) by ASCII Corporation.

* The files are converted into ISO-2022-JP (JIS) encoding.
* Makefile is adjusted to work with the latest pLaTeX + pBibTeX.
  Use platex/pbibtex instead of jlatex/jbibtex, and use -kanji=<enc>
  instead of -BIBFILECODE=<num> (e.g. number "20" meant EUC-JP input
  encoding is EUC-JP, similar to NTT JTeX \kanjifilecode number)
* test.tex uses \documentclass instead of \documentstyle.
* jplain.bbl.base (renamed from jplain.sav) is changed to work with
  pBibTeX 0.99d-j0.33. On Version 0.99d, BibTeX made output lines
  breakable only at white_space (so that, for example, URLs would not
  be broken).
